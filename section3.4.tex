\subsection{Preservation of Classical Reasoning}
As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:intro}, the central design principle of our language is that the quantum extension preserves the behavior of the classical fragment.
This guarantee is essential for programmers and compilers, as it ensures that classical reasoning and standard optimizations remain valid.
To formalize this, we first define contextual equivalence, which states that two terms are equivalent if their observable behaviors are identical in any context.
A context $C[\cdot]$ is defined as a closed term with a single hole $[\cdot]$ in it.
\begin{dfn}[Contextual equivalence] \label{def:contextual-equiv}
  For $M, N \in \Lambda$, $M\approx N \Leftrightarrow_\mathrm{def} \forall C[\cdot]\in\Lambda(\mathcal{U}).\ C[M] \Downarrow \Leftrightarrow C[N] \Downarrow$.
\end{dfn}

We conjecture that, as far as the classical fragment is concerned, the classical $\beta_V$-equivalence is sound with respect to the contextual equivalence.
Here, $\longleftrightarrow^*_\Lambda$ denotes the congruence closure of the classical reduction relation defined in Appendix~\ref{sec:opsem-full}.
\begin{restatable}[Preservation of $\beta$-equivalence]{conj}{ConservTheorem} \label{conj:conservativity}
  For all $M, N \in \Lambda$, if $M \longleftrightarrow^*_\Lambda N$ then $M \approx N$.
\end{restatable}
