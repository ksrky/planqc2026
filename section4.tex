\section{Future work}
We aim to develop both practical compilation techniques and theoretical extensions.
An intermediate language will be designed to explicitly describe interactions between classical and quantum systems through lower-level quantum operations.
Although the simply typed system is presented in Appendix~\ref{sec:type-system}, it can be extended with polymorphism and recursive types.
We are also working on a denotational semantics to formalize the language's mathematical interpretations.
