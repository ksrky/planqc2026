  Proof by contradiction.
  We assume $M \not\approx_{\beta} N$ for $M, N \in \Lambda$, and show that this implies $M \not\approx N$.
  The assumption $M \not\approx_{\beta} N$ means there exists a classical context $C[\cdot] \in \Lambda$ that distinguishes $M$ and $N$ in the classical fragment.
  Without loss of generality, let's assume $C[M] \Downarrow_\beta$ while $C[N] \Downarrow_\beta$ does not hold.

  Since $C[M] \Downarrow_\beta$, Lemma~\ref{lem:classical-eval} implies that $C[M] \Downarrow$.
  Since the evaluation of $C[N]$ under the classical rules diverges, the lemma implies that the evaluation of $C[N]$ in the full semantics must also diverge.

  Thus, the very same classical context $C[\cdot] \in \Lambda$ (which is also a valid context in $\Lambda(\mathcal{U})$) serves to distinguish $M$ and $N$ in the full quantum semantics.
  This establishes that $M \not\approx N$, completing the proof of the contrapositive.
